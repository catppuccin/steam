## Usage

### Automated installation (linux only):
Just run this command in your favorite terminal emulator!
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/steam/main/install.sh)
```

Or, if you use the fish shell, do this:
```fish
bash ( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/steam/main/install.sh | psub )
```
### Manual installation:

1.  Download the [original metro for steam](https://github.com/minischetti/metro-for-steam/releases/tag/v4.4), extract to `~/.steam/steam/skins/[name]` (linux) or `c:\Program Files\Steam\skins (windows)`. If the skins folder doesn't exist, create it.
2.  Download the [latest release of the metro patch](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin/tags)
3.  Extract the contents of [Unofficial 4.x patch/Main Files](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin/tree/master/Unofficial%204.x%20Patch/Main%20Files%20[Install%20First]) into the folder you put the original metro. Make sure to replace/overwrite, rather than skipping!
4.  Download your selected theme’s folder, located in [themes/](https://github.com/catppuccin/steam/blob/main/themes)
5.  Copy all contents of this folder into the folder with metro
6.  In steam, go to settings->interface, then change skin to the name of your metro folder. If you did this right, steam should prompt you to restart-- press OK, and steam should restart.
7.  Enjoy your new theme!
### NOTE: [steam-library](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-library), which the library styling is based on, has strange steps for windows-- until there is a separate implementation that accounts for this, windows users will only be able to style the header, and some of the panels.
### NOTE 2: Latte is extremely painful to theme for, so at the moment it isn't nearly as complete as the dark themes.

## TODO

- [x] Color all pages
- [ ] Find a way to edit the icons in the header
- [x] Look into an install script
- [ ] Look into better windows support
