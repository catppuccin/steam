<h2 align="center">🚧 This repository has been archived 🚧</h2>

Steam makes it incredibly difficult to properly and consistently theme. We have
instead archived this repository to avoid the unnecessarily high maintenance
burden of having an official Steam theme.

An **unofficial** theme,
[ctp-steam](https://github.com/Covkie/ctp-steam/tree/new-ui), has been created
by [Kylie 🍪](https://github.com/covkie) which may suit you.
